1. About                                                     *maximizer-about*

Maximizer lets you maximize split windows and restore them automatically. It
is very useful if you like to have many split windows per tab. And also, if
the text you are working with does not "...subscribe to the ridiculous Church
of 80-character Lines..."
(http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3250-clarity-over-brevity-in-variable-and-method-names)
It means, while working with Ruby on Rails code. ;) Or just with lengthy HTML
files.

2. Usage                                                     *maximizer-usage*

Maximizer has only one command: >

    :MaximizerToggle
<

It is meant to be mapped in many ways by the user himself. See
|maximizer-configuration| to get some examples.

When the current window is not in maximized state, Vim-Maximizer saves
dimensions and positions of all windows in the current tab, and then it
performs maximization of the active window. The second time the command is
invoked, Maximizer restores all windows to the previously saved positions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Configuration                                     *maximizer-configuration*

Maximizer is extremely handy with command mappings. The mappings can be
defined for normal, insert, and visual modes. Here is the example of the <F3>
key usage. You can paste it directly into your .vimrc file. >

    nnoremap <silent><F3> :MaximizerToggle<CR>
    vnoremap <silent><F3> :MaximizerToggle<CR>gv
    inoremap <silent><F3> <C-o>:MaximizerToggle<CR>

<

With these mappings you can hit <F3> any time, not only in normal mode. Other
handy situations may include typing some text while you don't fit the current
split window or selecting some long lines in the visual mode. Just try it
yourself.

Maximizer respects minimal allowed window size, both vertically and
horizontally. By default the minimal window height and width are set to 1.
You can change those values by tweaking |'winminheight'| (|'wmh'|) and
|'winminwidth'| (|'wmw'|) settings in your .vimrc.
